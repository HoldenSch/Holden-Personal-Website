# Project Reorganization Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully reorganized the website structure to put each project in its own folder for better organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Folder Structure**
- Created `projects/` directory
- Moved each project to its own subfolder:
  - `guess-who.html` → `projects/guess-who/index.html`
  - `monk-seal.html` → `projects/monk-seal/index.html`
  - `volunteer-app.html` → `projects/volunteer-app/index.html`
  - `canvas-calendar.html` → `projects/canvas-calendar/index.html`
  - `arcs-ios-app.html` → `projects/arcs-ios-app/index.html`

### 2. **Smart Navbar Updates**
- Updated `assets/js/navbar.js` to handle path resolution automatically
- Added `getBasePath()` function to detect current location
- Added `getAdjustedConfig()` and `getAdjustedProjects()` for dynamic path adjustment
- Updated project configuration to use new folder structure

### 3. **Path Corrections**
- Updated all relative paths in project files:
  - CSS: `assets/css/main.css` → `../../assets/css/main.css`
  - JS: `assets/js/*.js` → `../../assets/js/*.js`
  - Images: `images/*` → `../../images/*`

### 4. **Clean URLs**
Projects now have professional URLs:
- `/projects/guess-who/`
- `/projects/monk-seal/`
- `/projects/volunteer-app/`
- `/projects/canvas-calendar/`
- `/projects/arcs-ios-app/`

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Better Organization**: Each project in its own folder  
✅ **Clean URLs**: Professional-looking project paths  
✅ **Maintainability**: Centralized navbar management still works  
✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add new projects  
✅ **Smart Navigation**: Navbar automatically adapts to current location  
✅ **No Broken Links**: All paths automatically resolve correctly  

## How to Add New Projects

1. Create folder: `projects/new-project/`
2. Add `index.html` with proper relative paths (`../../assets/`, `../../images/`)
3. Add project to `projectsConfig` array in `assets/js/navbar.js`
4. Done! Navigation automatically updates across all pages.

## Files Modified

- `assets/js/navbar.js` - Enhanced with smart path resolution
- `projects/*/index.html` - Updated relative paths for all project files
- `NAVBAR_README.md` - Updated documentation

## Next Steps

The website is now fully reorganized and ready for easy project management. When you add new projects, simply follow the structure and the navbar will handle everything automatically!
