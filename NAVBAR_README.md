# Reusable Navbar Component

This website now uses a reusable navbar component to ensure consistency across all pages and make it easy to manage navigation updates. The projects are now organized in individual folders for better structure.

## Project Structure

The website is now organized as follows:
```
/
├── index.html                    # Homepage
├── about-me-temp.html           # Resume/About page
├── projects/                    # All projects organized in folders
│   ├── guess-who/
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── monk-seal/
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── volunteer-app/
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── canvas-calendar/
│   │   └── index.html
│   └── arcs-ios-app/
│       └── index.html
├── assets/                      # Shared assets
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── navbar.js           # Reusable navbar component
│   └── css/
└── images/                      # Shared images
```

## How It Works

The navbar is dynamically generated by `assets/js/navbar.js` and automatically loaded on all pages. It's smart enough to detect whether it's loaded from the root directory or a project subfolder and adjusts all paths accordingly.

### Key Features:
- **Centralized Navigation**: All navigation links are managed in one place
- **Auto Project Management**: Projects list is generated from a single configuration
- **Logo Handling**: Automatically shows logo on homepage, hides on other pages
- **Smart Path Resolution**: Automatically adjusts paths based on current page location
- **Easy Maintenance**: Add new projects without touching every HTML file
- **Organized Structure**: Each project has its own folder with clean URLs

## Adding New Projects

To add a new project:

1. **Create the project folder and file**:
   ```bash
   mkdir projects/your-new-project
   # Create projects/your-new-project/index.html with your content
   ```

2. **Add to navbar configuration**:
   Open `assets/js/navbar.js` and add your project to the `projectsConfig` array:
   ```javascript
   const projectsConfig = [
       { title: "Guess Who?", href: "projects/guess-who/" },
       { title: "Hawaiian Monkseal", href: "projects/monk-seal/" },
       { title: "Volunteer App", href: "projects/volunteer-app/" },
       { title: "Canvas Calendar", href: "projects/canvas-calendar/" },
       { title: "Arcs iOS App", href: "projects/arcs-ios-app/" },
       { title: "Your New Project", href: "projects/your-new-project/" } // Add this!
   ];
   ```

3. **Ensure proper paths in your project file**:
   In your `projects/your-new-project/index.html`, use these paths:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../assets/css/main.css" />
   <script src="../../assets/js/navbar.js"></script>
   <img src="../../images/your-image.jpg" />
   ```

4. **Add the navbar placeholder**:
   Include this comment where you want the navbar:
   ```html
   <!-- Header and Menu will be inserted by navbar.js -->
   ```

## Clean URLs

With the new structure, your projects have clean URLs:
- `your-site.com/projects/guess-who/`
- `your-site.com/projects/monk-seal/`
- `your-site.com/projects/volunteer-app/`
- etc.

## Configuration Options

The navbar can be customized by modifying the `navbarConfig` object in `navbar.js`:

```javascript
const navbarConfig = {
    logoHref: "about-me-temp.html",        // Where logo links to
    logoImage: "images/holden-pfp.png",    // Logo image path
    logoTitle: "Harvard University",        // Main logo text
    logoSubtitle1: "Computer Science",      // First subtitle
    logoSubtitle2: "& Economics",          // Second subtitle
    homeHref: "index.html",                // Home page link
    resumeHref: "about-me-temp.html"       // Resume page link
};
```

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: All pages have identical navigation
- **Easy Updates**: Change navigation once, updates everywhere
- **New Projects**: Add projects in one place, appear everywhere
- **Organized Structure**: Each project in its own folder
- **Clean URLs**: Professional-looking project URLs
- **Maintainability**: Centralized navigation management
- **Smart Path Handling**: Works from any directory level
- **Flexibility**: Easy to customize styling and behavior

The navbar component automatically detects the current page location and adjusts all navigation paths accordingly, ensuring everything works perfectly whether you're on the homepage or any project page.
